# Emacs cheatsheet

## Notation
- C is the control key.  M is the meta or alt key.
- If your meta or alt key doesn't work, press and then release  <esc>.
- Key chords are combinations so  "C-h t" means press control and h at the same time, release, then press t
- For the embedded Emacs tutorial C-h t


## File Processing
    C-x C-f     open new file
    C-x C-v    open another file instead, in the same buffer
    C-x C-s    Save file
    C-x C-w   Save as and then type file name in mini buffer.  Same as "save as"
    C-x k       Close or "kill" current file
    C-g          Quit command.  This is great when you accidentally type the wrong command **
    C-x s       Save all modified files
    C-x C-c    Exit emacs


## Buffers
